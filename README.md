# Crotale
Crotale is a C++ codebase built from a collection of modular libraries.

A set of crotales is a musical instrument made from many small cymbals of different pitches.
In the same way, the Crotale codebase aims to provide small but useful packages of code, following
the design principle of "only pay for what you use."

## Submodules
* [Crotale Core](https://github.com/jacob-thomas7/crotale-core): The base library for setting up an application.
* [Crotale Utils](https://github.com/jacob-thomas7/crotale-utils): A set of widely-applicable utility functionality.
* [Crotale GameDev](https://github.com/jacob-thomas7/crotale-gamedev): A game engine based on [SDL3](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL).
* [Crotale Console](https://github.com/jacob-thomas7/crotale-console): Tools for text-based applications.
